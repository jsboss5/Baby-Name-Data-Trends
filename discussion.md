## Lab Discussion
### Joshua Boss, Delaney Demark


NOTE: Delaney and I talked thoroughly through both of our code and didn't end up doing any actual coding during the session. 
We wrote down notes to go back and help with refactoring and gave eachother good tips! We both used intelliJ ToDO comments to help us with this.

### Issues in Current Code

 * What pieces of code help versus obscure your understanding?
    - create a variablebefore returning 

 * What names in the code are helpful and what makes other names less useful?
    Helpful:
    - variable names of the maps in mostPopularGirls make sense. 
    Unhelpful
    - "Lines" variable name is bad
    - While Loop guard - in topgirllettermethod
    - the thing.charAt(0).charAt(0.....) is bad
    
    
 * What additional methods might be helpful to make the code more readable or usable?
    I already have a lot of additional methods - I think what is more helpful for me is to instead make my methods more adaptable. 
    

 * What assumptions does this code have?
   - I use a forward slash for dealing with directories, so maybe it wouldn't work on a windows? Though I'm not sure. 
 * What comments might be helpful within the code?
       
 * What Code Smells did you find?
     - BAD VARIABLE NAMES


### Refactoring Plan

 * What are the code's biggest issues?
    - It's very long
 * Which issues are easy to fix and which are hard?
    easy
    - variable names and method names are easy -
     hard
    - while changing the structure of the data base is hard
 * What are good ways to implement the changes "in place"?
    Change something and test it immediately. 

### Refactoring Work
